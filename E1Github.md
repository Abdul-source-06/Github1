# Exercise 1: Creation and Documentation on GitHub


## Step 1: Create an Account on GitHub

First of all, we create an account on GitHub (https://github.com/) and register.

## Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Start by logging into your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "New" button at the top right corner of the main page.
3. Fill in the repository information:
   - **Repository name:** E1GitHub.
   - **Public or Private:** Set it to public.
4. Click on "Create repository"

## Step 3: Clone the Repository to the Local Machine

Open the terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdul-source-06/-Github.git
```

## 4. Add a file named E1Github.md

Now, I change to the repository directory:

```bash
cd /c/Users/ahsch/Github1
```
Next, I create a file named E1Github.md:
```bash
touch E1Github.md
```
## Step 6: Commit and Push the Changes
To add the file in the repositary:
```bash
git add E1Github.md
```
To add "coments" about the repositary:
```bash
git commit -m "Process Github"
```
To upload the repository to github:
```bash
git push origin main
```
